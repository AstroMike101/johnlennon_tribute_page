    <h2> Impacts on the world  </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lennon created many inspiring songs, such as <i>"Imagine"</i> which encouraged listeners to imagine the world at peace without the divisions caused by religion,nationality, and materialistic things</li>
      <li> He knew that there were people who wished for the same things as him. This included peace, liberation, and happiness. The song above spoke directly to the hearts of many likeminded people and had a massive impact on society as a whole.
      <li> He used his platform and music to speak against things he didn't agree with. This included the Vietnam War. He advocated for peace, and the ending of senseless killing<li>    
      He expressed his concern about African-American rights and displayed growing intrest in Femenism. This brought about media attention as well as attention from society as a whole towards issues that are not often talked about
